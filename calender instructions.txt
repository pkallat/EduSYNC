RUNNING THE PROJECT
make sure credentials.json is in the same directory as calender.py 
in your terminal run the command "pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib" may need to add python3 before pip for it to work
also run "pip install flask" 
once you run the code open your browser and go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

RUNNING THE TESTS
make sure unitts.py is in the same directory as the rest of the code
run "pip install coverage" 
in the terminal run "python -m unittest unittest"
to see the coverage report run "coverage report"

SYSTEM TESTING:
Once the app is running (`python calender.py`), follow these steps to test it manually:

1. Open your browser and go to "http://127.0.0.1:5000".
2. Test creating events:
   - Fill in the event name and date in the form.
   - Submit it, and check if the event shows up in your Google Calendar.
3. Test deleting events:
   - Use the delete option on an event.
   - Make sure the event is removed from your Google Calendar.
4. Test invalid inputs:
   - Leave the event name blank or enter a bad date format.
   - Check if the app shows an error or handles it without breaking.

NOTES:
- You’ll need to complete the Google login process (OAuth flow) in your browser when testing.
- Some rare errors (like expired tokens or too many API requests) can’t be tested easily, so we just note them as untested.
